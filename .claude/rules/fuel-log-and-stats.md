# Fuel log, consumption and statistics

## Fuel log and statistics

- Domain: fuel log. `Vehicle` and `Refueling` entities have private setters and `Create` factories that enforce the rules (throwing `DomainException`); Application services (`VehicleService`, `RefuelingService`, `ResourceSharingService`, `ImageService`) use repository ports; the GraphQL error filter maps `DomainException` / `NotFoundException` to `VALIDATION_FAILED` / `NOT_FOUND` errors.
- Fuel consumption (`Refueling.Consumption`, fuel per 100 distance units between full fill-ups) is stored, not computed on read: `ConsumptionCalculator` (pure, Domain) recomputes a vehicle's whole chain and returns only the logs whose value changed; `RefuelingService` calls it after every log/update/delete/restore (`RecalculateConsumptionAsync`; imports pass `recalculateConsumption: false` and recalculate once; the seeder applies it directly) and `DatabaseMigrator` backfills once after the `AddRefuelingConsumption` migration. A log with `MissedPreviousFillUp` (a fill-up before it was not logged; GraphQL `missedPreviousFillUp`, omitted on update = kept) breaks the chain: its interval has no consumption and the next one starts from it. Anything that changes logs, odometers, volumes, full-tank or missed flags must go through that path.
- Statistics (`Application/Stats`): `StatsCalculator` (pure) turns a vehicle's live records (`IStatsRepository.LoadAsync`) into chart data and key figures; costs are always per currency, never converted, and drawn on a scale per currency too (#159: `ChartView` gives every currency of a `CURRENCY` chart a y axis of its own, `dashboard/chartFormat.ts` `chartAxes`; see the frontend rule's Charts). The vehicle summary (card and dashboard key figures) has a main currency (most spent in over the last year) for `thisMonthSpend`/`lastMonthSpend`/`spendTrend`, plus `spending` (`CurrencySpend` per currency used this month or last, main first), which the UI shows joined (`spending.ts` `spentText`: "52,000 Ft · €73.90") so nothing spent in another currency goes unshown. A chart is a `ChartConfig` (metric, grouping, kind, range incl. custom from-to, stacked) that `Validated()` normalises (dates dropped for presets); saved ones are `VehicleChart` rows (typed columns, personal or shared, managed by `ChartService`). Presets live in the frontend (`dashboard/DashboardPanel.tsx`) and use the same `vehicleChartData` query. Add a metric = enum value + calculator case + i18n (`charts.metrics.*`) + builder rules in `dashboard/chartFormat.ts` (`normalise` mirrors `ChartConfig.Validated`).
