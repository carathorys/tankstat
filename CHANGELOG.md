# Changelog

Every release of Tankstat, newest first. Each one is a Docker image, `ghcr.io/carathorys/tankstat:<version>`, and a [GitHub release](https://github.com/carathorys/tankstat/releases). The numbers in brackets are the pull requests. Pre-releases (the previews) are not listed: their changes are in the release that followed them.

## 0.16.0 (2026-10-15)

### Added

- **A setup page for a new instance** (#130, #131, #132, #139): a new instance with no administrator waits for its setup instead of stopping. Its log names a one-time code (the line starting "Setup is waiting"); with it, the setup page at the server's address opens one wizard:
  - the Server settings page's groups, a step each, the sign-in mode first and chosen on purpose;
  - then the gatekeeper: the first administrator in Standalone, the acknowledgement that everyone sees and changes everything with sign-in off, or in OIDC and proxy mode the administrators named in `Auth:AdminEmails` or the first person who signs in and claims it;
  - one restart at the end when a saved setting waits for it, then a done screen with the backups' key set and what to set up next.

  *Restore from a backup* instead lists the backups folder and takes an upload, so moving a server to a new machine starts on its setup page. The setup is skipped where the environment already decides it: the bootstrap administrator, `Auth:AdminEmails`, or `Setup__Enabled=false`. An instance that holds data counts as set up.
- **The settings file in every backup** (#143): a backup carries the app's own settings file (the instance's settings only, never the machine's: no database, folders or keys folder), and a restore brings it back, keeping this server's previous file as `settings.json.bak`. A restore is judged by the settings it would leave, so a moved Standalone server can no longer come up with sign-in off: a file this server would not start with is refused before anything changes.
- **The environment's settings recorded or merged** (#144): `Backups:Environment` (*Settings from the environment* on the Server settings page). *Names only* (the default) names in the backup the settings its server's environment variables held, never a value; *Names and values* also puts their values into the backup's copy of the settings file (never into the server's own). `backup --environment record|merge` chooses for one run.
- **A restore is refused while a recorded setting has no value here** (#144): neither this server's environment nor the restored settings file holds it. The refusal names the variables: set them, then restore. A log level (the `Logging` section) is the exception: it never refuses a restore (#148).
- **What a restore can break, said before it** (#146, #148): each backup's row on the Backups page and the setup page says what refuses its restore here ("Refused") and what it risks ("Risk": no settings file, secrets left out, settings this server's environment overrides, the sign-in mode above all, log levels this server lacks). The restore dialog says each in full, and a risk must be acknowledged before *Restore and restart*. The `restore` command prints the same.
- **Secrets in backups by choice** (#148): `Backups:Secrets` (*Secrets in backups*) puts the OIDC client secret, the SMTP password and the model API key into the backup's settings file; off by default, with a warning on the Server settings page while backups are not encrypted. A backup always names the secrets it leaves out. `backup --secrets` for one run.
- **Hold a backup** (#148): a held backup is never removed by retention and cannot be deleted until it is released (*Hold* / *Release* on the Backups page, or a `<file>.hold` file beside it with sign-in off).
- **Open a backup** (#148): a dialog per backup, on the Backups page and the setup page, with what its manifest says: release, database and migration, encryption, what it holds, every table with its rows, its settings file and the variables its server's environment set.

### Changed

- **A plain backup that holds its secrets is marked** with a red open padlock on the Backups page (#148).
- **A value the server refuses is said at its field** (#139), like the form's own checks, everywhere: the log, vehicle, schedule, visit and chart dialogs, the restore and key-set dialogs, and the Server settings page.
- **The one-time code** for a restore with sign-in off is now the instance's setup code, 12 characters shown `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` (#130).

### Fixed

- **Two requests that create the same user at once** (#145): a proxy user's first page, whose requests come together, or an administrator's *Create user* sent twice. One creates the user and the other reads it; before, the loser ended with an error (a 500 through a proxy). An administrator another server made at the same moment now completes the setup.

### Upgrading

- One migration, `AddSetup`, applied at start; as with every migration, the start writes a backup of the database first. An instance that holds data counts as set up: it shows no setup page.
- **A new instance with nothing configured waits for its setup instead of stopping**: in Standalone without the bootstrap administrator, its address shows the setup page. An unattended deployment that should never see it sets the bootstrap administrator (as before), `Auth:AdminEmails` in OIDC or proxy mode, or `Setup__Enabled=false`.
- **Backups now hold the settings file, and restores check the settings**: a backup of 0.16 restored on a server without the variables its server set is refused until they are set here (the refusal and the Backups page name them). With *Names and values* the backup carries their values instead.
- **No backup holds the secrets unless `Backups:Secrets` is on**, encrypted or not. A restore keeps this server's own secrets where the backup has none. Backups written by 0.15 restore as before and bring no settings file.
- The Docker Compose example now runs 0.16 (`TANKSTAT_VERSION` in `.env.example`), and its administrator variables may be left empty to use the setup page.

### For developers

- **A fourth test layer: real-browser tests** (#135, #136, #137): Playwright against the published build at phone and desktop size (`mise run test:e2e`, CI's `e2e` job in two shards): a layout check (no sideways scroll, values inside their panels, 44 px touch targets), axe with the real styles, and the user flows by area, each as a user of its own, with a video of a failed test. Every new user flow gets a Playwright test (#141 steadied a flaky one).
- The issue workflow's skills use the main checkout, with no git worktree unless asked; CI does not run for a change of Markdown files only (#142).
- `SettingsInBackups.CategoryOf` sorts every setting the app binds as the instance's, a secret or the machine's, and a test fails for one left unsorted (#148).

## 0.15.1 (2026-10-14)

### Fixed

- **Label and value lists on a phone** (#127): on a narrow screen each label now stands above its value, and a value wraps instead of running past its panel. Before, the Server settings page squeezed the environment's settings into a one-word column, long addresses and ids ran off the screen under their help buttons, and a long settings-file path made the whole page scroll sideways. On wider screens the label column takes at most 40 %. This covers every such list: Server settings, Overview, Backups and Account.
- **Touch targets of 44 px on a touch screen** (#128): the app's name in the top bar, and every text link that is not part of a sentence. That means the Overview's user and vehicle counts, the vehicle names under Administration, then Vehicles, the Backups page's link to its settings, a chart's *Show the data as a table*, a sync conflict's *Open*, *Continue to sign in* after setting a password, and a notification's link. Nothing changes with a mouse.
- **The Docker Compose example runs 0.15** (#126): `.env.example` said `0.14`, which ignores the example's backup settings without a word. Its comments now name the tags that exist (`0.15` follows the patches, `0.15.0` stays put, `latest` moves with every stable release) and say that the example's backups need 0.15 or later.

### Upgrading

- Nothing to do: no migration and no setting changed. `0.15` and `latest` move to this release.
- If you started from the Compose example with `TANKSTAT_VERSION=0.14`, read 0.15.0's *Upgrading* below, then set it to `0.15`: the example's backups only run from 0.15.

### For developers

- `.claude/rules/frontend.md` has a *Touch targets* rule: `standaloneLink` (`theme/components.ts`) for a link that stands on its own, and links in a sentence are exempt (#128).
- `.claude/rules/docker-and-release.md` says which image tags each release gets, and that a new minor release's changelog PR also moves the Compose example's `TANKSTAT_VERSION` (#126).

## 0.15.0 (2026-10-13)

### Added

- **Backups in one file** (#107): every table, the pictures, the photos of logs (when they live with the pictures, or with `Backups:Photos` when they have a folder of their own) and, in an encrypted backup, the keys that keep people signed in. Encryption is the `age` format exactly, so a backup opens with `age -d` too; the server keeps only the recipient, never a key that opens its own backups. Commands next to the server: `backup`, `backup keygen` and `decrypt`. The image writes them to `/data/backups`.
- **Restore a backup** from the app or with `tankstat restore` (#110, #118): the server restarts in its own process and applies it first thing at that start, before the database migrations, replacing the data as a whole. A backup moves between SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and MySQL, and one made by an older release is brought up to date as an upgrade would be; a newer release's is refused before anything is written. Devices with offline data notice the restore, download afresh, and list what the server no longer has under *Found on this device* on Waiting to sync, to send again or forget.
- **A Backups page** for administrators (Administration, then Backups) (#112, #118): back up now, upload, download, restore and delete backups, see each one's kind, release, rows, encryption, photos and size, and make a key set for encryption.
- **Scheduled backups and retention** (#113, #118): `Backups:Every` (one or more times of day, the server's time) on the days of `Backups:Days`, with `Backups:Keep` and `Backups:KeepDays` removing the old ones. A backup missed while the app was down is written at its next start, and a failed one tells the administrators, once a day at most.
- **A backup before every upgrade** (#118): a start that migrates a database holding data first writes a backup of it as it is (a safety net).
- **The backup settings on the Server settings page**, applied at once; *Make a key set* saves its recipient and salt there with one button (#117).
- **Time and date formats per user** (#118): the top bar's *Language and formats* menu offers a 24-hour or 12-hour clock and five date formats, kept with the account. *Default* follows the new `Defaults:TimeFormat` and `Defaults:DateFormat`, else the language.
- **The server's folders on the administration overview** (pictures, photos of logs, backups, sign-in keys, the settings file), each with what it holds and its environment variable (#118).
- **A Docker Compose example** with PostgreSQL and Mailpit, and an `.env.example` (#119).

### Changed

- The Server settings page words its choices (the value after them), warns that no sign-in is not secure, and the *Defaults for new vehicles* tab is now *Defaults* (#118).

### Upgrading

- Two migrations, `AddInstanceGeneration` and `AddUiFormats`, applied at start. **That start writes a backup of the database first**, as every start that migrates a database holding data now does; when it cannot be written, nothing is migrated and the start stops with the reason in the log. Keep the backups folder writable (`/data/backups` in the image, created for the app's user) and leave room for one more backup.
- `Backups:Path` must not be a storage folder, lie inside one or hold one; the start refuses that. With the image's default `/data/backups`, a `Storage__Path=/data` needs a `Backups__Path` outside `/data` or a narrower storage folder.
- **A restore keeps no copy of the data it replaces**: whatever changed since the restored backup was made is gone. Download or copy a backup of the current state first if you might want it back.
- Backups are plain until a key set is made (the Backups page, or `backup keygen`); a plain backup leaves the sign-in keys out, so restoring one signs everyone out once.
- Keep a copy of the app's own settings file (`/data/settings.json`) with your backups: the backup settings saved on the page live there, and no backup holds it.

### For developers

- `CHANGELOG.md`, carried by every release (#115).
- The release smoke test checks that a setting of a group that applies at once counts at once, and that a sign-in setting waits for the restart (#116).
- `CLAUDE.md` keeps what holds everywhere plus an index; each area's rules are in `.claude/rules/<area>.md`, loaded when a file of the area is read (#118).
- Backup fixtures: files written by `age` 1.3.2, and the committed backup of an older migration that every release must restore; `ProviderRoundTripTests` moves a backup between real servers when given their connection strings (#107, #110, #118).

## 0.14.0 (2026-10-12)

### Added

- **Server settings for administrators** (Administration, then Server settings): every setting with where its value comes from (the environment, the settings file, `appsettings.json` or the built-in default), a tab per group, and changes saved into the app's own settings file. Defaults, notifications, offline sync and logging apply at once; sign-in, e-mail and photo reading after *Restart server*, which restarts the server in its own process, so the container keeps running. A setting the environment holds is read-only there, and a secret is never shown back (#106, #108, #114).
- **The app's own settings file**, `Settings:Path` (`/data/settings.json` in the image): a configuration source below the environment variables and above `appsettings.json`. A file the app could not start with is left out at start, with an `Error` line naming the settings at fault and a public notice (#105).
- **An Administration group** in the navigation: an Overview of what needs an administrator, People (users and access), Vehicles (the full list, moved out of the main navigation) and Server settings (#114).
- **The photos of logs under a root of their own**, `Storage:PhotosPath` (opt-in; nothing moves unless it is set) (#95).

### Changed

- A start in another sign-in mode than the previous one signs every device out (#106).
- Self-service password resets are throttled, with one live link per user (#94), and their e-mail goes out after the answer, so the answer tells no accounts apart (#104).
- `Smtp:Security` takes MailKit's names: `Auto`, `None`, `StartTls`, `StartTlsWhenAvailable`, `SslOnConnect`. The `Ssl` the docs used to list was never one of them and runs as `Auto`, as it always did (#105).

### Fixed

- In mode `None`, a sign-in cookie left over from another mode no longer names a user (#98).
- An administrator keeps the setup link to hand over when its e-mail cannot be sent (#99).

### Upgrading

- Nothing to do: the image reads `/data/settings.json` from the data volume, and the file appears with the first change saved on the Server settings page. Environment variables still win over it.
- A settings file that would leave the instance without sign-in when left out stops the start instead: that is a file that sets the sign-in mode while the environment does not, over the shipped `None`. Fix the file, or set `Auth__Mode` in the environment.
- For TLS from the first byte to the mail server, set `Smtp__Security=SslOnConnect`.
- The old addresses keep working: `/admin?tab=users` and `?tab=access` lead to People, `/vehicles` to Administration, then Vehicles.

### For developers

- The review skill: a PR is claimed with `reviewing` and labelled `reviewed` when done (#101).
- A log canary ignores a needle that a random id spells by chance (#102).
- Code lookups go through the LSP (#103).
